## Predicting Bike Rentals with Azure Machine Learning

This project investigates leveraging an Azure Machine Learning endpoint to predict bike rentals. The process utilizes a pre-built model, trained on historical data, to analyze weather and seasonal features and estimate rental demand.

For detailed instructions on creating and deploying the model, along with sending requests to the endpoint for predictions, refer to the Microsoft Learn module: [Explore Automated Machine Learning in Azure ML](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AI-900-AIFundamentals/instructions/02-module-02.html).

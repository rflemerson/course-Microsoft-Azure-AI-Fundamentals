# Exploring Optical Character Recognition and Image Analysis with Azure AI Vision

In these project we will test Azure AI Vision's capabilities to explore optical character recognition (OCR) and image analysis. With Vision Studio, we can experiment with extracting text from images and analyzing image content without writing any code. By creating an Azure AI services resource and connecting it to Vision Studio, we can try out OCR functionalities with different types of images and analyze images using features like image captioning, dense captioning, tagging, and object detection.

In this lab, I utilized "The Creation of Adam" for picture captioning and "Letter from Birmingham Jail" for OCR tasks.
